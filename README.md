# Automated-Pedestrian-Detection-Activity-Surveillance
Engineered a Random Forest Classifier (98.57% accuracy) to detect and classify suspicious pedestrian activities like kick, punch, robbery, shooting, and hit. Used OpenCVâ€™s HOG detector for pedestrian identification and trained on 46K+ labeled images for robust, high-precision predictions.
